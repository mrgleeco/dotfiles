Chars/Unicode
-------------

Fun With Unicode ٩(●̮̮̃•̃)۶
  Following up on the last post, you can also use CTRL-V to enter unicode characters. All you have to do is the following:

  CTRL-V u (unicode character hex code)

  Note that you can also combine multi-byte character

When typing in insert or ex mode, hiting CTRL-V allows you to enter a literal character. Some examples:

  CTRL-V CTRL-M # enters a literal carriage-return \r
  CTRL-V 10 <enter> # enters a null character
